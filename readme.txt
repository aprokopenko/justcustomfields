Turn WordPress into more powerful CMS by adding advanced and easy to use custom fields

== Description ==

Just Custom Fields adds ability to extend your Posts, Pages (and other custom post types) with additional fields. After installation, you will see a simple settings page, which is self-explanatory to use.
We use the standard WordPress PostMeta API to save fields data, so you can use standard WordPress functions in your themes/plugins to get data.

**IMPORTANT** We do not recommend update plugins on your existing sites from version 2.* to version 3.0+.
JCF v3.0+ is not compatible with versions 2.*, so some field settings can be lost (and as a result - wrong values on post edit pages).

Plugin supports such field types:

* Input text
* Select Box
* Multiple Select Box
* Checkbox (single and multiple)
* Textarea (you can use WordPress editor too)
* Datepicker
* Simple Media (files and images upload)
* Table
* Fields Collection (repeatable fields groups)
* Related Content (to set a relation to another Post/Page or Custom Post Type)

You can read full documentation on our site: http://justcustomfields.com.

For quick demo you can watch our presentation video:

Starting from v2.0 we have different options to save plugin configuration:

* Ability to set Fields Settings global if you have MultiSite. So you can set them once, without copying all settings to every new site.
* Ability to save Fields Settings to a file system (inside theme or wp-content folder). We expect this option will be popular among the developers. It will be much easier to move your fieldsâ€™ settings between site versions (dev/production).

Starting from v2.2:

* Simple Media field is now a single file only (before it was multiple). It uses new media upload box from WordPress and saves post thumbnail ID (before it was just a file url). So now you can use the get_the_post_thumbnail() function to work with attachments.
* All fields now have "Shortcodes" and hints how to use them inside the templates for non-professional developers.

For easy migrations between different sites, we have Export/Import options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: Where can I edit new fields for Posts or Pages? =
A: After installation and activation of the plugin, you will see a new menu item under Settings > Just Custom Fields

= Q: My site works slow, is it something wrong with your plugin? =
A: Plugin files are included and affect only in the WordPress dashboard. They affect only the Post edit pages and the Just Custom Fields settings page. So it can't affect the site speed.

= Q: How can I add my own component (new field type)? =
A: First of all you need to create a new PHP class for your field. Your class should be extended from the Just_Field plugin class!
You can start from copying the existing class /[plugins-folder]/just-custom-fields/components/input-text.php to your plugin folder or theme and update the code:

- Change the class name
- Change the class methods to use your specific controls and data.

Class structure is very similar to the WordPress Widget API classes.

Then you need to include your new component file into your plugin main file or theme functions.php file.

And the last step:

- Add a new action hook "add_action('jcf_register_fields', 'my_register_fields_function')"
- Add a new callback function similar to this one:

function my_register_fields_function(){
jcf_field_register('YOUR_COMPONENT_CLASS_NAME');
}
