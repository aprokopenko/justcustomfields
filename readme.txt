This plugin add custom fields for standard and custom post types in WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin add custom fields for standard and custom post types in WordPress. After installation you will see simple settings page which is self-explanatory to use.

For now plugin support such field types:

* Input text
* Select Box
* Multiple Select Box
* Checkbox (single and multiple)
* Textarea (you can use editor light for it)
* Date Picker\*
* Upload Media (for upload files and images)
* Fields Group (for grouped textual data)
* Table
* Related Content (to set relation to another Post/Page or Custom Post Type)\*

_\*NOTE: Available **only** for WordPress 3.1+ (Related Content field works in Select mode). WordPress 3.0.\* has old  jQuery/jQuery UI versions and they are not compatible with DatePicker and Autocomplete fields._

**IMPORTANT** In version 1.3 added new functions to use in theme templates to print Upload Media fields content. Read more about it on plugins home page:
http://justcoded.com/just-labs/just-custom-fields-for-wordpress-plugin/

**IMPORTANT** Starting from version 1.4 all fields machine names (slug) will be started from underscore ('_'). This prevent appearing them in standard WordPress Custom fields meta box.

**EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES**

Starting from v2.0b we have new experimental features:

* Ability to set Fields Settings global if you have MultiSite. So you can set them once, without copying all settings to every new site.
* Ability to save Fields Settings to file system. Directly in the theme. We expect this option will be popular among the developers. It will be much easier to move your fields settings between site versions (dev/production).
* Export Fields Settings
* Import Fields Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Q: Where can I edit new fields for Posts or Pages? =
A: After installation and activation of the plugin you will see new menu item under Settings > Just Custom Fields

= Q: My site works slow, is it something wrong with your plugin? =
A: Plugin files are included and affect only in WordPress dashboard and affect only Post edit pages and Just Custom Fields settings page. So it can't affect the site speed.

= Q: How can i add my own component (new field type)? =
A: first of all you need to create new php class for your field. Your class should be extended from Just_Field plugin class!
You can start from copying the existing class /[plugins-folder]/just-custom-fields/components/input-text.php to your plugin folder or theme and update the code:

- change class name
- change class methods to use your specific controls and data.

Class structure is very similar to WordPress Widget API classes.

Then you need to include your new component file into your plugin main file or theme functions.php file.

And the last step:

- add new action hook "add_action('jcf_register_fields', 'my_register_fields_function')"
- add new callback function similar to this one:

function my_register_fields_function(){
	jcf_field_register('YOUR_COMPONENT_CLASS_NAME');
}
